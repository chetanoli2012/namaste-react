# Episode 3

- JSX - not HTML inside js

- JSX - can be said, has HTML like or XML like syntax

- Code is written for fellow humans first and then for machines. So, it's very important that it is readable. Hence we don't use react's core methods to create react elements. This gives birth to syntactical sugar-coats like JSX.

- JSX is not pure js. JS natively doesn't support jsx. JS engine does not understand JSX. It only understands ecmascript. However JSX does get rendered in browsers because before it goes to the browsers, it gets transpiled into native HTML, CSS, JS. Babel is used for transpiling.

- React.createElement => React Element - Object => rendered as HTML element

- JSX = React.createElement => React Element - Object => rendered as HTML element

- If we have to give attributes to jsx elements, we camelCase it.

- we enclose multi line jsx in (). This is construed as starting and endpoint for babel while transpiling.

* React components

- Class components - OLD
- Functional components - NEW - it's just a normal javascript function that returns some JSX
  - The name of the component should always be capitalized, else there will be an error. This is React's way of knowing it's dealing with components.

* Component composistion is nothing but using React component inside the other components. Essentially composing multiple components.

* JSX automatically takes care of XSS by sanitizing the rendered data.
