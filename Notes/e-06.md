# How do different services [ UI, BE, SMS ] task to each other in microservices architecture

- We have different port mapping for differen services
  - domain.com/ (UI) mapped to port :1234
  - domain.com/api (BE) mapped to port :2020
  - domain.com/sms (SMS) mapped to port :1000
- If the UI wants to interact with BE, it'll make call to domain.com/api

- Two ways to fetch data from BE

  - Make an api call when the app loads and render the data onto the ui when data is received. On this apprach, the screen seems to have frozen for the duration taken to fetch the data. And all of a sudden, everything appears

  - As soon as the app loads, render the ui [whatever can be rendered, mostly, skeleton UI]. Then make the api call to get the data and render updated data. [React always follows this second approach]. This has better UX. We render here 2 times, but it does not really matter because the render cycle of react is very fast.

## Every time a local state variable is updated, the entire component gets re-rendered (entire re-conciliation mechanism is reinitiated)
