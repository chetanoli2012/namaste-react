# React Hooks:

- Normal JS inbuilt functions in react.
- Most used hooks: useState and useEffect
- useState() : used to generate super powerful state variables in react
- useEffect(): used to handle side effects

- Whenever a state variable changes, react re-renders the component

## Reconciliation Algorithm [ React Fiber ]

- React creates the virtual DOM of the existing DOM tree. Virtual DOM is not an actual DOM but it is a representation of the same. It's basically a react object that every elemnt is represented into. React uses [ Diff Algorithm ] to find the difference between two virtual DOMs. This difference is used to update the actual DOM on every render cycle.
