# Optimizing our app

## Single responsibility principle

- Any single identity of code, be it a function or a class or any single identity, it should always have a single responsibility. If we have a body component is intended to display the UI, it should only do that. We need to move the logic to custom hooks.
- The single responsibility principle also helps in UTs and in overall debugging. This make entire codebase easily testable.
- This increase reusability.
- Overall maintainability also increases because of this.
- There is not any hard and fast rule when it comes to maintaining components with single responsibilty. However, it general rule of thumb to keep components as light as possible.
- Custom hooks are used to decouple logic from components.
- Hooks (built-in or custom) are just normal utility functions.
- Creating custom hooks is not mandatory but it makes code more readable, reusable and testable

## Chunking | code splitting | Dynamic bundling | Lazy loading | On-demand loading | Dynamic import

- Breaking down bundles, like js bundle, into multiple files.
- When we think of breaking single files into bundles, the general rule of thumb is to think in a way that, a bundle should contain enough code for a feature.
- It's important to split file so as to ensure smaller bundle sizes and network calls are not that heavy. This provides smooth user experience and a perfromance boost.
