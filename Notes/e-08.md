# Let's get classy

## Class based components

- When class based components are used in web app, objects of those coponents are created.
- Whatever is passed into this.setState(), react will only update that state variable.

## Functional components

- When fucntional comonents are used in web app, it's as simple as invoking corresponding fucntions that return JSX

## Life cycle of class based components

- When any component is instanticated, the order of executions is as follows:

  - `constructor`
  - render()
  - componentDidMount()

- In case of parent child relationsip:

  - Parent constructor
  - Parent render
  - Child constructor
  - Child render
  - Child componentDidMount
  - Parent componentDidMount

- Essentially, all of child's life cycle is component is completed before parent's life cycle methods post render are resume

- When there are multiple childrens, the CDM of children's are deferred and batched in order (child1, child2) for optimizations. Render phase and commit phases for multiple childrens are batched together. The batching is done as a part of optimizatio step. DOM MANIPULATIONS ARE VERY EXPENSIVE

  - Parent constructor
  - Parent render

    < RENDER BATCHING >

    - Child1 constructor
    - Child1 render
    - Child2 constructor
    - Child2 render

    < DOM UPDATES BATCHING >

    - Child1 componentDidMount
    - Child1 componentDidUpdate
    - Child2 componentDidMount
    - Child2 componentDidUpdate

  - Parent componentDidMount
